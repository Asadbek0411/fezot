            <h1>Welcome to Finale Season!</h1>
            <p>Fellow Clashers,

                The road to the Clash of Clans World Championship is about to start with the first community tournament
                coming up just around the corner - the Queso Cup Golden Edition!.</p>

        <p>Fellow Clashers,

            The road to the Clash of Clans World Championship is about to start with the first community tournament
            coming up just around the corner - the Queso Cup Golden Edition!
            <br>
            <br>
            If you are a Town Hall 14 player and you aim to compete with the best players in the world on the big stage,
            this is your opportunity. Together with your teammates, you can already sign up to the first Open Qualifier
            as a team of 5 members and take your shot at the ultimate glory.
            <br>
            <br>
            Up to 1024 teams can participate in each Open Qualifier in the Queso Cup Golden Edition with the first Open
            Qualifier starting on March 19th and the second Open Qualifier starting on March 26th.
            <br>
            <br>
            The top 8 teams from each qualifier (16 teams in total) will advance to the next stage where the teams will
            be challenged with a new format that has never been done before in the Clash of Clans esports history: a
            Swiss bracket where teams need to obtain 3 wins in order to qualify for the Playoffs. The Swiss bracket will
            happen on April 3rd.</p>
